Simple example codes for Java stream api

A Stream in Java 8 can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source. Streams supports aggregate operations on the elements. The source of elements here refers to a Collection or Array that provides data to the Stream.

Stream keeps the ordering of the elements the same as the ordering in the source. The aggregate operations are operations that allow us to express common manipulations on stream elements quickly and clearly.

# Intermediate Operations
1.filter() 2.map() 3.flatMap() 4.distinct() 5.sorted() 6.peek() 7.limit() 8.skip()

# Terminal Operations
1.forEach() 2.forEachOrdered() 3.toArray() 4.reduce() 5.collect() 6.min() 7.max() 8.count() 9.anyMatch() 10.allMatch() 11.noneMatch() 12.findFirst() 13.findAny()

In this repository we will try to understand about all of these method.
